### Requirements

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

You will need a Firebase project and firebase tools cli

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ivallejo/todo-typescript-api.git .
```

You need to change the firebase project name in *.firebaserc* file.

After that, you can log in to firebase in the terminal 

```
firebase login
```


### Deploy

For the first time, you have deploy the hosting and functions together

```
cd functions/
npm run deploy
```


### Locally

In order to test the tasks function locally, run the following command:

```
cd functions/
npm run serve
```


### Test

Run the following command:

```
cd functions/
npm run test
```
